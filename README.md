# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# This is my personal portfolio, built from scratch in React.

It uses global context and responsive web design, with media break points at mobile, tablet, and desktop widths. The Projects section is populated from the data.js written by me. All images come from the projects I have completed, the image links to the deployed website, and the name to the github repo.

Styling is broken up on a per-component basis, and imported into the main styles file (index.css).

The website also has functionality to switch between English and Polish Language.
